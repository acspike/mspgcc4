- offer "install-strip" to get Ubuntu 9.10 amd64 installed size from 250 MB to
  just under 100 MB

- check that most of the things don't discard expensive material (downloads,
  checkouts, builds, configure caches)

  * Ivan added MPFR as an exception because the webserver doesn't support
    required features for "wget -c".

- remove code duplication in the various do-*.sh scripts, see num_cpus and the
  sourced buildgcc.subr file for a sample

- support command-line configuration for tools

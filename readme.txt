To build a certain version of MSPGCC, ensure that you have the "dialog" package installed and run the "buildgcc.sh" script.

NOTE! Stripping output binaries assumes that only mspgcc and related material
installed by this script will be found under the given prefix. Other executables
will also be stripped without further notice!
